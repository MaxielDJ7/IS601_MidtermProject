# Description

üìå Command-Line Calculator (Python)

This project is a modular, professional-grade command-line calculator application built in Python. It emphasizes clean architecture, error handling, testing, and continuous integration with GitHub Actions.

‚ú® Features

- REPL Interface: Interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop for continuous calculations.

- Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, modulo, intdivide, and absolutediff.

- Calculation Management: Uses a CalculationFactory to create calculation objects and maintains a history of operations.

- Special Commands: 

    - history ‚Äì Display calculation history.
    - clear ‚Äì Clear calculation history.
    - undo ‚Äì Undo the last calculation.
    - redo ‚Äì Redo the last undone calculation.
    - save ‚Äì Manually save calculation history to file.
    - load ‚Äì Load calculation history from file.
    - help ‚Äì Display available commands.
    - exit ‚Äì Exit the application gracefully.

- Robust Error Handling: Handles invalid input and division/modulo by zero gracefully.
- Showcases multiple design patterns Factory, Memento, Observer, and Decorator.

üß™ Testing

- Unit & Parameterized Tests with pytest for all components.

- 90% Test Coverage enforced via pytest-cov and GitHub Actions.

- Coverage Exceptions: Specific unreachable lines (e.g., pass, continue) marked with # pragma: no cover.

‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflow runs tests and checks coverage on every push/PR.

- Test coverage 90%.
